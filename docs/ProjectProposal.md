## 2. Project Description
The Jackson Laboratory's Computational Sciences department would like to start the process of 
rebuilding HaploQA, legacy scientific application. It is motivated to do so due to a request for a
major new feature, and to bring the application in line with current application interoperability
goals.


> HaploQA is a software platform that provides interpretation of genotype calls from the Mouse 
> Universal Genotyping array platforms (including Mega-/Giga- MUGA) that are available from Neogen 
> Genomics (Morgan et al., 2015). The software allows for direct upload of sample and genotype data,
> sample annotation, and organization by users. The software interprets genotype calls and uses 
> established Hidden Markov Models that were generated by Dr. Gary Churchillâ€™s laboratory to 
> generate haplotypes with negative log likelihood scoring. There are additional options for 
> interfacing with the data through a web-based graphics, links out to widely used genome browsers, 
> data/image/report downloads, and options for making the data public. If you want to read more 
> about MUGA platforms the following is a great resource:

## 4. Project Goals
List all of your project goals divided up into primary, secondary and tertiary 
goals. 
- Primary goals 
  - Lay the Software Engineering Groundwork for the project to rebuild HaploQA 
  - Complete at least one identified possible code contributions
- Secondary goals 
  - TODO
- Tertiary goals 
  - TODO: 
  - (maybe something like Contributed code has complete test coverage)

### Possible Code Contributions
- Roux team rewrites the front-end entirely
- Roux team takes the existing visualizations and makes them pluggable modules
- Roux team writes a new FastAPI back end that is responsible for managing the "QA/QC" app, storing 
only data necessary for that app, and interacting with services for HMM and Genotype/SNP Storage

- GeDI team takes a new "General AIL QTL2 Library" to replace Keith's HMM for Haplotype 
reconstruction of Non-DO mice
- GeDI team moves genotype intake to SIP
- GeDI team moves genotype/snp sample storage to BigQuery
- GeDI team provides API end-points to fetch sample data and genotype probabilities for HaploQA

## 5. Approvals
Describe how and when you received approval for this project from your 
instructor and how/when you got approval from your client(s).
Give the date and method of approval from all your team members.

Approvals will happen through the GitHub.com Pull Request system.
