# Testing Plan

## Project Description

## Over all testing plan 
Describe your testing approach to your software, team member assignments, how 
you will avoid bias, will you test as you go or at the end, what type of testing
you will do and anything else you want me to know. 

Specific test cases use the most current version of the project's 
[Test Case Template](./TestCaseTemplate.md).

## Static Testing
Static tests include things like convention, code quality, code structure, etc. 

Describe how you will conduct static testing on your finished code base. What 
will you test for? How will these tests be conducted and by whom? Justify your 
plan.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests provide testing of individual modules, classes, or functions. This 
testing is best done as you develop. 

Describe how you will break your tests into unit tests and plan out some of your
unit tests. 

## Integration Tests
Describe your integration tests if applicable. Will you use bottom up or top 
down? Provide at least 3 unless you can justify why they aren’t needed. 

## Validation Tests

Describe your validation tests. At the least you’ll need a requirements review 
and client evaluation.


## System Tests
Describe your system tests if applicable. Provide at least 3.
