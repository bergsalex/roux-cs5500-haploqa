# Team Member Assignment and Contract 
## Roux HaploQA
#### Version 2.0.0 (November 8th, 2021)
This document is tracked in version control. See the git repository for the full history of this 
document. Changes to this document are only to be made after full approval by the team, see details
below.

## Team Members and their associated roles: 
These roles are open to change and revision. Members can switch positions, support each other, 
and review each other's work (see the "Organization/Justification" section below).To start, we will
adopt the following "boundary spanning" roles. Once we have an initial set of requirements and have
had a chance to meet with the entire team we will consider moving to the "internal roles"

### Internal Roles
The following roles are preliminary. We will fully define each role and assign initial leads after
our first meeting with the entire team present.
- Team Lead: Alexander Berger
- Development Manager: All members (for now)
- Planning Manager: Fangrui Guo
- Quality/Process Manager: Fangrui Guo
- Requirements/Support Manager: Alexander Berger

## Team Member Organization/Justification:
Open - members can switch positions, support each other, and review each other's work

This is a small distributed team working on a highly dynamic project. Selecting an open style 
will allow us to be adaptable in our role assignments as project details become more clear or as 
requirements shift. At the same time, an open style tackles some challenges associated our team
being distributed in that it allows us to explicitly define our group's roles as well as who is 
currently assigned to / responsible for them.

## Communication Systems:
- Email: for moderately and highly asynchronous communication
- Northeastern's Microsoft Teams: for synchronous and lightly asynchronous communication
- GitHub: for document sharing, code contributions, review and feedback

## Team Expectations: 
Contributions will be tracked and documented through the use of our version control system. The team
will add all project contributions to the code repository in some form, which will allow us to track
contribution metrics through the version control server software (GitHub). 

Code change to the `main` branch will only be done through a "pull request" with review and 
approvals from the team. 

Work for class will be discussed and assigned "submitters" to specify who will submit the actual 
assignment. As the team and project mature, we will consider tracking responsibilities and 
submissions in the documentation in this code repository.

## Changes to This Contract
Changes to this document are only to be made after full approval by the team. All members must
approve a GitHub "pull request" before the valid version of this document (the version on the `main`
branch) can be changed. 

## Code Commit Signatures

By Adding my name below this line I acknowledge that I agree to the above responsibilities assigned 
to me, and to the change system proposed by this document. 

> Add your name and the date of your signature on a new line below

### Type your name/date here. Putting anyone elseâ€™s name here will be considered academic dishonesty.
