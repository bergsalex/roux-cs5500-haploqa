## Introduction
### Purpose
Provide capability for interpretation of genotype calls from the Mouse Universal Genotyping 
  array platforms.   
  - Lay the Software Engineering Groundwork for the project to rebuild HaploQA 
  - Deliver a modularized visualization
  - Deliver a frontend application that utilizes the modularized visualization
### Conventions
### Intended Audience
### Overall Description
> HaploQA is a software platform that provides interpretation of genotype calls from the Mouse 
> Universal Genotyping array platforms (including Mega-/Giga- MUGA) that are available from Neogen 
> Genomics (Morgan et al., 2015). The software allows for direct upload of sample and genotype data,
> sample annotation, and organization by users. The software interprets genotype calls and uses 
> established Hidden Markov Models that were generated by Dr. Gary Churchillâ€™s laboratory to 
> generate haplotypes with negative log likelihood scoring. There are additional options for 
> interfacing with the data through a web-based graphics, links out to widely used genome browsers, 
> data/image/report downloads, and options for making the data public. If you want to read more 
> about MUGA platforms the following is a great resource:
