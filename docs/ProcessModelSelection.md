# Process Model Selection

## Outcome: Agile / Scrum

### Why did you choose this model?
This model will provide some mitigation for time-zone differences and overall project uncertainty,
and also aligns with current industry practice as well as the process used by our clients.

### What makes this model ideal for your project/team?
This model inherently allows and accounts for the challenges that can arise due to our spatially
and temporally distributed team. The process allows us to design an asynchronously oriented model
both in effort delivery and communication, planning and design. 

### How will your team carry out this model?

### Backlog
Once wil complete our [Software Requirements Specification](./SoftwareRequirementsSpecification.md),
we will have an all hand team meeting to create our initial backlog. The backlog will include not
just project requirements or features that provide business value for the customer, but also all 
project requirements for the completion of the Roux - CS5500 Project

After that, we will have a backlog prioritization meeting at the end of each sprint where we:
- Review / Curate / Estimate new items
- Allocate Items to sprint

### Sprints
Sprints are two weeks in length, starting and ending at the start of every other Roux - CS5500 
class, Monday at 1pm in Portland Maine.

### Scum / Stand-ups Meetings
We will have daily asynchronous scrum / stand-up meetings via Microsoft Teams, and one weekly
Zoom based scrum / stand-up meeting.

Each team member will post the following daily:
1. What did you do since the last team meeting?
2. What obstacles are you encountering?
3. What do you plan to accomplish by the next team meeting?

Additionally, each team member will respond to any relevant discussion, especially when involving
obstacles that their fellow team members are facing.

### Product Demos
Once we being delivering work, we will have a demo at the end of every sprint. This demo will always
include the team, and will also include project clients when available.
