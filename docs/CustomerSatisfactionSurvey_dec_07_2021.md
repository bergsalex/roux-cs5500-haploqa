## Responses
This survey was conducted with Anna Lamoureux and Dave Walton from The Jackson Laboratory's computational
sciences department, they two primary clients and contacts for this project.

1. Does what we currently have to deliver match your overall goals and priorities for this project?
- The client indicated that they are exceptionally pleased that we chose to prioritize delivery of 
the visualization package.
2. Is there anything you would have had us change in how we prioritized our work?
- The client indicated that it would have been nice to see work reimplementing pages, but that the 
delivered work allows them to begin using the visualizations in an interoperable way immediately. 
3. Do you expect that you will use the result of this project as was laid out in the project proposal?
- The client does not anticipate any change in plans for the project and fully expects to use the 
visualization package in the HaploQA rebuild.
4. Is there sufficient documentation for an initial deliver? / Does the documentation comprehensively
explain the usage of the package to you expectations?
- The client believes the documentation is sufficient for them to begin developing with the package.
5. Is there anything which you believe would block delivery of this as a useful product to you?
- The client hasn't yet identified a private package repository which can host the result of this
package, something not mentioned in requirements gathering. Otherwise, the client has indicated
that they have everything they need in the project.
